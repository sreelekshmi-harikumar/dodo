# 🐣 Easter Prank Chain

A fun Easter prank you send to your friends as a link. It looks like a cute egg-catching game, so they have no idea what's coming. They tap a falling egg, watch it zoom in and slowly crack open, then get hit with a confetti explosion and a surprise they definitely weren't expecting.

After the prank hits, the site asks them to do the same thing to one of their friends — type in a name, get a personalized link, share it to WhatsApp in one tap. It keeps going from there.
